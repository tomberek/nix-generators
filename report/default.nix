# Create a "runtime report" of the runtime dependencies of `drv`. A "runtime
# report" is made up of smaller "dependency reports". A "dependency report" is
# a string describing the dependency, made from the dependency's derivation
# attributes. Here we use `mkReport` to make the report of any particular
# dependency.
#
# NOTE: we use the following terms:
#
#   * "buildtime" to mean basically any derivation involved in the build of
#     `drv`.
#   * "buildtime-only" for the "buildtime" dependencies that _are not_
#     referenced anymore by `drv`'s store entry.
#   * "runtime" for the rest.
#
# The "runtime report" is created in two steps:
#
#   * Generate reports for all the _buildtime_ dependencies with
#     `buildtimeReports`.
#   * Filter out the reports for buildtime-only dependencies.
#
# Most of the "buildtime" reports won't even be used, because most buildtime
# dependencies are buildtime-only dependencies. However Nix does not give us a
# way of retrieving the derivation attributes of runtime dependencies, but we
# can twist its arm to:
#
#   * Give us the store paths of runtime dependencies (see `cinfo`).
#   * Give us the derivation attributes of all the buildtime dependencies (see
#     `buildtimeDerivations`).
#
# Here's the hack: `buildtimeReports` tags the reports with the (expected)
# store path of the "buildtime" dependency, which we cross check against the
# list of runtime store paths. If it's a match, we keep it. Otherwise, we
# discard it.
